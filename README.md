# Fine-Tuning Falcon-7B for E-commerce FAQ Assistance

This project showcases the fine-tuning of the Falcon-7B large language model to create a specialized conversational AI for answering frequently asked questions (FAQs) in the e-commerce domain. The goal is to equip e-commerce businesses with an AI-powered assistant that can efficiently handle customer queries, enhance user experience, and reduce manual support efforts.
By using parameter-efficient fine-tuning techniques like LoRA (Low-Rank Adaptation) and leveraging quantization to optimize resource usage, the project achieves a balance between high model performance and deployability on limited hardware.

# Key Features

1) Domain-Specific Fine-Tuning: The Falcon-7B model is adapted to understand and respond accurately to e-commerce-related queries.
2) Lightweight Training: Utilized LoRA for efficient fine-tuning with reduced computational overhead.
3) Quantized Inference: Used 4-bit quantization (BitsAndBytes) to make the model training and deployment resource-friendly.
4) Custom Dataset: Trained on a dataset of e-commerce FAQs, formatted for seamless integration with Hugging Faceâ€™s ecosystem.
5) End-to-End Pipeline: Includes dataset preparation, fine-tuning, model saving, and inference scripting for real-world deployment.

# Technical Workflow

1. Dataset Preparation
Preprocessed a JSON dataset containing e-commerce FAQ pairs (questions and answers).
Converted the data into a format compatible with Hugging Face Datasets and Tokenizer for training.
2. Model Fine-Tuning
Loaded the Falcon-7B model using Hugging Face Transformers.
Integrated LoRA adapters for parameter-efficient fine-tuning.
Trained using a cosine scheduler and AdamW optimizer for optimal learning.
3. Model Saving
Saved the fine-tuned model and tokenizer locally to facilitate deployment without relying on external model hubs.
4. Inference Pipeline
Built an inference script to generate dynamic and contextually relevant responses.
Designed for easy integration into real-world applications, such as chatbots or virtual assistants.
